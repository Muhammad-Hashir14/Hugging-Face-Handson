**Hugging Face Transformers and Datasets Notebooks**
This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate the use of the Hugging Face transformers library and the datasets module. These notebooks provide examples of various NLP tasks and techniques for handling datasets.

**Notebooks
**1. Basic NLP Tasks with Hugging Face Transformers**
This notebook covers the following tasks using the Hugging Face transformers library:

**Text Summarization:** Generate concise summaries of longer text documents using pre-trained models.
**Question Answering:** Provide answers to questions based on a given context using state-of-the-art models.
**Named Entity Recognition (NER):** Identify and classify named entities (such as people, organizations, and locations) within a text.
**Text Generation:** Generate coherent and contextually relevant text based on a given prompt.
The notebook showcases how to leverage pre-trained models from the Hugging Face model hub to perform these tasks efficiently.

**2. Handling Datasets with Hugging Face Datasets Module**
This notebook demonstrates the usage of the Hugging Face datasets module for managing and processing datasets:

**Loading Datasets: **Load datasets from various sources using the datasets library.
**Tokenization:** Apply tokenization using models from the transformers library. This includes:
**Tokenizing with Pre-trained Models:** Use a tokenizer associated with a specific model to preprocess text data.
**Custom Tokenization:** Implement custom tokenization strategies as needed for specific use cases.
Evaluation Metrics

The notebooks also cover two main evaluation metrics for Large Language Models (LLMs):

**BERT Similarity Score:** Measures the similarity between text pairs using BERT-based models. This score helps evaluate how closely related two pieces of text are.
**BLEU Score:** Evaluates the quality of text generated by comparing it to reference text. The BLEU score is commonly used in machine translation and text generation tasks.
